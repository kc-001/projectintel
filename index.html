				<h2>What is a Project Managment Plan(PMP)?</h2>
				<p>A Project Managment Plan (or Work Plan) is a tool for outlining and managing a project's performance. <br><br>The Project Management Plan is the roadmap to your project's succes and should account for deliverables, schedule milestones, resources and costs. </p>

				<h2>How to develop a Project Managment Plan?</h2>
				<p>The Project Management Plan should be scaled to your project size. It can be as complex as need for large multi-year, multi-phased projects. Or is can be broad based but emcompassing of all project deliverables.</p>
				<hr>
				<p> Step 1: Set Scope</p>
				<p> Step 2: Layout Deliverables</p>
				<p> Step 3: Establish Scheudle Milestones</p>
				<p> Step 4: Allocate Resources</p>
				<p> Step 5: Execute and Evaluate</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
				PMPs are typically created in a combination Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Project. These tools are extremely powerful for this purpose however they lack reliable automation features which renders the PMP less likely to utilize once the initial plan is executed.
